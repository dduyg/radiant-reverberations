# RADIANT REVERBERATIONS

This is a visually engaging display showcasing the sampling of incoming light on the surfaces of hemispheres. It provides a playful representation of the principles behind irradiance sampling. The upper and lower hemispheres depict virtual surfaces, where points on the spherical surfaces are sampled to approximate the amount of incoming light, creating a dynamic pattern that simulates light interaction with surfaces in a 3D space.

The resulting simulation aims to demonstrate the concept of irradiance sampling in an interactive and simplified manner. Irradiance sampling is a technique used in computer graphics that mimics the realistic interaction of light with surfaces in virtual environments. It involves sampling points on a surface to approximate the amount of incoming light at each point. By realistically simulating the complex interplay of light on surfaces, this sophisticated technique allows us to achieve high-quality, lifelike computer-generated images close to the visual richness found in the real world.
